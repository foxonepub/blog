##### ⌗ Clean navigation

Intuitional navigations are used widely in Fox.ONE. You will always know where you are, and find what you want.

##### 🙆🏽‍ TEE integration

In TEE supported devices, you can use Face ID or Touch ID instead of the PIN authorization.

##### 🛡 Better PIN protection

The simple but strong protection is fortified by serious cryptography in the backend. Our engineers work really hard to keep your information and cryptocurrency assets in safe. What you need to do is to remember the PIN and never don’t tell anyone.

## Explore the market with DATA
