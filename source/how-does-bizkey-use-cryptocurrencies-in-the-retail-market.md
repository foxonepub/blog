## Opportunities And Challenges

It’s said that blockchain technology will subvert the traditional Internet and bring great changes to people’s life. There is a large amount of capital and manpower invested in this emerging market. In the last three years, blockchain enterprises are springing up like mushrooms. Let’s review this set of data:

The industry is fiercely competitive and a series of difficulty and uncertainty occurs in this process, but Bizkey is confident about the future.

It’s a big opportunity for the crypto community to get back to doing the hard work of building the future in peace and quiet with the exposure of awkward media and frenzied speculators.


## About Bizkey

Bizkey is committed to expediting blockchain adoption through retail. With the decentralization of today’s marketplaces, services and networks, the transitional market of retail remain mostly untapped by technology, stuck with inefficiencies on logistics, payments, service quality, and accounting.

Bizkey adopts the method of transaction accounting, i.e. mining, to dig out the value of data assets and share passenger flow. At the same time, the digital currency opens the door for offline payment through a more reasonable business path.

## Solution

Bizkey is a feature-ready platform introducing intelligent blockchain-based POS systems ( Biz-POS ) that support a variety of powerful applications to streamline and re-integrate merchants into the digital era, laying a solid foundation for the new era of ubiquitous digital lifestyles.
